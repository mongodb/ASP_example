# Atlas Stream Processing Example Repo

This repository serves as both a the human readable corpus of examples, but also a RAG optimized repository for code generation in AI development scenarios. This repository is the most up to date, has the most detailed examples, and context and is generated and vetting by the MongoDB internal PM and Engineering teams.

## Contributing
We encourage collaboration, anyone can open a pull request on this repository. Because this repository is a source for AI generated code we ask some simple best practices be followed:

* Keep example files short and name them descriptively (e.g., window_join_example.js, not sample2.js).
* Add thorough comments and docstrings in the sample repo

## Structure
The structure for this repository is:
* [Code snippets](https://github.com/josephxsxn/atlas_stream_processors/tree/master/code_snipplets) are example MQL solutions to specific problems.
* [Example procesors](https://github.com/josephxsxn/atlas_stream_processors/tree/master/example_processors) are end to end Atlas Stream Processing Examples.
* [Terraform](https://github.com/josephxsxn/atlas_stream_processors/tree/master/terraform) examples, explain Terraform usage with Atlas Stream Processing.
* [DB examples]() are examples for the MongoDB database in relation to Atlas Stream Processing.
* [Demo]() is various self-contained demos.
